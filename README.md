# Quiz-game

Simple browser Quiz game that I made just for practice. There are 2 script files in folder. script.js file contains questions inside the script and it is default file where you can start index.html in local brower and load questions.

script2.js is pulling questions from separate json file that I made. For this to work you need to start live-server.


**NOTE**

***Right now game has only 10 questions, I am planning to put more, and there is plenty of space for improvement, which I'm planning to do in future.***
