# Quiz-game

Simple browser Quiz game that I made just for practice. You get random question and you answer by entering a number of correct answer.

There are 2 script files in folder. *script.js* file contains questions inside the script and it is default file where you can start index.html in local browser and load questions.
*script2.js* is pulling questions from separate .json file that I made. For this to work you need to start a live-server.


**NOTE**

***Right now game has only 10 questions, there is plenty of space for improvement, which I'm planning to do in future. I am planning to put more questions, add score to count how many correct answers user have etc..***
